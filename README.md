# Innovative CRM Project Delivers Exceptional Results 
I'm thrilled to share my latest achievement: a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) project that showcases my        
technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills - all achieved without the aid of eyes!                                      

As a blind individual, I've relied on my trusty NVDA screen reader to navigate the digital world. And yet, despite these unique      
challenges, I've successfully developed this CRM project using:                            

## Technical Highlights                   
* **Frontend**: VueJS, with Pinia for stage management, providing a seamless user experience that's accessible to everyone -         
including those who rely on assistive technologies like NVDA.                              
* **Backend**: NodeJS server with ExpressJS, ensuring efficient data processing and scalability. Paired it with MongoDB as the       
database, utilizing Mongoose as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for effortless data manipulation.                           
* **REST API**: Created a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring authorized access to critical data      
- all navigated through the power of NVDA.
* **Frontend Framework**: Leverage WordPress (WPA) to deliver a user-friendly interface that's accessible to everyone,               
including those who rely on assistive technologies like NVDA.                              

## Personal Touch                         
As someone who's blind and uses NVDA to navigate digital platforms, I understand the importance of accessibility. This project       
demonstrates my commitment to creating inclusive experiences that benefit everyone - regardless of visual abilities.                 

## Ongoing Learning Journey               
When not working on exciting projects like this CRM solution, you can find me exploring new horizons in Python, AI, Machine          
Learning, and Deep Learning. Stay tuned for more innovative accomplishments!
